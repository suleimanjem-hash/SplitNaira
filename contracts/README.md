# SplitNaira Soroban Contract Spec

This document defines the public interface exposed by `SplitNairaContract` in `contracts/lib.rs`.

## Data Model

### Collaborator
- `address: Address` - Collaborator Stellar address.
- `alias: String` - Human-readable collaborator label.
- `basis_points: u32` - Share in basis points (`10_000 = 100%`).

### SplitProject
- `project_id: Symbol`
- `title: String`
- `project_type: String`
- `token: Address` - Token contract for deposits/distributions.
- `owner: Address` - Project owner/admin.
- `collaborators: Vec<Collaborator>`
- `locked: bool`
- `total_distributed: i128`
- `distribution_round: u32`

### ClaimableInfo
- `claimed: i128` - Total amount paid to collaborator for project.
- `distribution_round: u32` - Last completed distribution round.

## Public Methods

### Admin + Allowlist

### `set_admin(admin: Address) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Sets or rotates contract admin.
- Auth: `admin` (first setup) or current admin (rotation).
- Errors: `Unauthorized` via auth checks.

### `allow_token(admin: Address, token: Address) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Allowlists a token contract address.
- Auth: contract admin.
- Errors: `AdminNotSet`, `Unauthorized`.

### `disallow_token(admin: Address, token: Address) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Removes a token from allowlist.
- Auth: contract admin.
- Errors: `AdminNotSet`, `Unauthorized`.

### Project lifecycle

### `create_project(owner, project_id, title, project_type, token, collaborators) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Creates a split project and initializes project balance to `0`.
- Auth: `owner`.
- Errors: `ProjectExists`, `TooFewCollaborators`, `ZeroShare`, `DuplicateCollaborator`, `InvalidSplit`, `TokenNotAllowed`, `ArithmeticOverflow`.

### `update_collaborators(project_id, owner, collaborators) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Updates collaborator split definitions when unlocked.
- Auth: `owner`.
- Errors: `NotFound`, `Unauthorized`, `ProjectLocked`, `TooFewCollaborators`, `ZeroShare`, `DuplicateCollaborator`, `InvalidSplit`, `ArithmeticOverflow`.

### `lock_project(project_id, owner) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Locks collaborator configuration permanently.
- Auth: `owner`.
- Errors: `NotFound`, `Unauthorized`, `AlreadyLocked`.

### `update_project_metadata(project_id, owner, title, project_type) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Updates title/type while unlocked.
- Auth: `owner`.
- Errors: `NotFound`, `Unauthorized`, `ProjectLocked`.

### Funds flow

### `deposit(project_id, from, amount) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Transfers `amount` from `from` to contract and credits `ProjectBalance(project_id)`.
- Auth: `from`.
- Errors: `InvalidAmount`, `NotFound`.

### `distribute(project_id) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Distributes project balance to collaborators by basis points.
- Auth: none (permissionless trigger).
- Errors: `NotFound`, `NoBalance`.
- Compatibility invariants:
  - `distribution_round` increases once per successful distribution and never on failure.
  - `total_distributed` increases by the exact amount paid out.
  - Any rounding remainder is assigned to the final collaborator so the full project balance is consumed.

### `withdraw_unallocated(admin, token, to, amount) -> Result<(), SplitError>`
Admin-only recovery of tokens held by contract but not tracked in any project ledger.
- Unallocated formula:
  - `token_balance(contract) - sum(project_balance for projects using token)`
- Safety: Cannot withdraw more than current unallocated amount.
- Auth: contract admin.
- Errors: `AdminNotSet`, `Unauthorized`, `InvalidAmount`, `InsufficientUnallocated`, `ArithmeticOverflow`.

### Read-only queries

### `get_project(project_id) -> Option<SplitProject>`
Returns project or `None`.

### `project_exists(project_id) -> bool`
Cheap existence check that does not load full struct and never panics.

### `get_claimed(project_id, address) -> i128`
Returns total claimed amount for collaborator in project.

### `get_claimable(project_id, collaborator) -> Result<ClaimableInfo, SplitError>`
Returns claimed amount plus project `distribution_round`.
- Errors: `NotFound`.

### `get_balance(project_id) -> Result<i128, SplitError>`
Returns project-scoped distributable balance.
- Errors: `NotFound`.

### `get_unallocated_balance(token) -> Result<i128, SplitError>`
Returns token units held by contract that are not attributed to any project balance.
- Errors: `ArithmeticOverflow`.

### `get_project_count() -> u32`
Returns total number of created projects.

### `list_projects(start, limit) -> Vec<SplitProject>`
Paginated projects.
- Compatibility invariants:
  - Creation order is stable.
  - Windowing semantics stay aligned with `get_project_ids(start, limit)`.
  - Metadata edits, locking, deposits, and distributions do not reorder or remove entries.

### `get_project_ids(start, limit) -> Vec<Symbol>`
Paginated project IDs in creation order.
- Compatibility invariants:
  - This is the canonical creation-order index app layers can page over.
  - Returned IDs must line up position-for-position with `list_projects(start, limit)`.

### `is_token_allowed(token) -> bool`
Returns allowlist status.

### `get_allowed_token_count() -> u32`
Returns count of allowlisted token addresses.

### `get_admin() -> Option<Address>`
Returns current admin.

## Machine-Consumable Interface

The generated interface artifact lives at:

- `contracts/interface/splitnaira.contract-interface.json`

It is designed for backend and frontend tooling that needs contract method names, argument order/type names, event topic/data shapes, app-facing contract types, storage key variants, and error codes without scraping Rust or duplicating README tables.

Refresh it whenever `contracts/lib.rs`, `contracts/events.rs`, `contracts/errors.rs`, or `contracts/Cargo.toml` changes. The generator uses Node.js and no additional npm packages:

```bash
npm run generate:contract-interface
```

`npm run build:contracts` also refreshes the artifact after a successful contract build. Commit the refreshed JSON with the contract change so app layers and code generators can diff the contract surface in review.
## Regression Guarantees

The contract test suite includes upgrade-safety regression coverage for the app-facing assumptions most likely to break compatibility:

- Pagination semantics: `list_projects` and `get_project_ids` stay aligned by index and preserve creation order across later project mutations.
- Metadata mutability: only `title` and `project_type` may change while unlocked; ownership, collaborators, token, lock state, and payout history remain untouched.
- Payout accounting: collaborator payouts, claimed ledgers, `distribution_round`, `total_distributed`, and rounding-remainder handling stay internally consistent across repeated rounds.

## Events

  - Data: `"afrobeats_vol3"`

### `unallocated_withdrawn`
